       <h2> About  Visual Studio </h2>
       <p> 
        Visual Studio Code is a streamlined code editor with support for development operations like debugging, task running, and version control. 
        It aims to provide just the tools a developer needs for a quick code-build-debug cycle and leaves more complex workflows to fuller featured IDEs,
         such as Visual Studio IDE.</p>

         <p>It usually means a combination of a display monitor and an input device, usually a keyboard and mouse pair, which allows a user to input commands
              and receive visual output from a computer or computer system. ... A console is also known as a computer console, a system console or simply as a 
              terminal.</p>
